/*
Algorithm 1 (naive)

The first solution is a naive protocol where we keep one shared variable items with the number of items in the buffer. Each producer would simply wait until items<N before writing whereas each consumer would wait until items>0 before consuming. Encode this solution in Promela and check its correctness. We should find a counterexample where a deadlock is reached. Print the counterexample trace using "spin -t -p ..." and add a textual or graphical explanation of what has happened. Try with different values for the number of producers and consumers or for the buffer size.*/
